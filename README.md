This repository contains the `did:web3` Decentralized Identifier Method
Specification. You can access the latest version of this specification here:

The W3C Community Group that is works on the specification of which this is a
fork can be found here:

## Editing and building the specification

This specification uses [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/) html. Just edit `index.html` and the draft will be rendered correctly.

When it's time to do a static snapshot, we use the ReSpec UI in the browser to export static HTML.

## Note re well-known

You do NOT need to register your instance of a `did:web` with IANA.  Please do NOT attempt to do so.  As things stabilize, the editors of this specification may register the file(s) of this specification with the well-known uris registry.  These registries are for the paths to files themselves that are specified, not for individual implementations.
