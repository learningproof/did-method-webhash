    <p>
      DIDs that require a distributed ledger or trusted clients for resolutions
      face significant practical challenges in anchoring trust for many
      use-cases targeted by the DID WG at W3C. Conversely, however, DNS-based
      methods have little in the way of verifiability and are susceptible to
      malicious or duplicitous DID controllers abusing control of domains under
      their control, as DID documents in the classic did:web model are neither
      signed nor self-certifying, with no standardized mechanisms defined for
      witnessing structures to vouchsafe historical authenticity. We propose a
      new DID method extending did:web with additional trust and verification
      properties based on standard hashing methods that can be extended in
      implementation-specific ways, while also offering backwards compatibility
      for the trust models and use-cases supported by did:web.

      <h2>
        Design Constraints and Motivation
      </h2>

      <p>
        This DID method was developed with the following design constraints:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Static web hosting</strong>: DID Documents must be able to
          be hosted on static web servers (with no support for query parameters
          or custom HTTP headers).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prefer Backwards compatibility</strong>:
          Whenever possible, `did:webhash` DIDs should be resolvable by <code>did:web</code>
          resolvers. That is, for a given DID, if the
          <code>webhash</code> method keyword is changed to <code>web</code>,
          an existing DID Web resolver is able to fetch and process it.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Modular Trait-Based Design</strong>:
          The various security features added to this method (as compared with <code>did:web</code>)
          should be modular, and reusable by any other DID Method.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Trust Model
        </h3>

        <div class="issue">Add section on the did:webhash Trust Model (requires
          DNS/ICANN/CA infrastructure for resolution, website operator has the power
          to disrupt key rotation chains, which means Witnesses are ultimately
          necessary).
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Separation of Server Operator and DID Controller
        </h3>

        <p>The division of responsibilities into two different parties,
          separating the web server Operator from the DID Controller, is a primary
          motivation for creating a new DID method instead of continuing to
          use <code>did:web</code>.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Is crucial in "multi-tenancy" scenarios (either via subdomains
          or subdirectories).</li>
          <li>Allows for greater availability, archiving, and migration to
          other domains or other DID methods.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Relationship to Other DID Methods
      </h2>

      <p>
        This DID method is an iteration over the original <code>did:web</code>
        method, and exists in conversation with similar web-derived
        microledger-based methods currently under development.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>did:web</code> - No key rotation history; the DID Document
          contains only the latest valid keys. Unsigned DID docs.</li>
        <li><code>did:webs</code> - see the
          <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/">DID Method did:webs Specification</a>.
          Key rotation events at a separate location (in KERI format).
        </li>
        <li><code>did:webplus</code> - see
          <a href="https://github.com/LedgerDomain/did-webplus">https://github.com/LedgerDomain/did-webplus</a></li>

      <section>
        <h3>Enhancements and Differences from <code>did:web</code></h3>

        <p>The differences are nonbreaking and additive (see the Design
          Constraints section).</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Introduces the <code>previous</code> term for backwards chaining,
            as well as a corresponding algorithm for chain verification.</li>
          <li>DID Documents must be signed.</li>
          <li>Requires the use of the <code>controller</code> term (specifically,
            DID document update and key rotation events must be signed by
            the <code>controller</code> DID (specifically, by a key
            authorized in its <code>assertionMethod</code> section).
          </li>
          <li>Requires the use of an entropic identifier as a path fragment.</li>
          <li>Because there is always a path fragment, no <code>.well-known/</code>
            directory mechanism is used for a DID at the "top" domain level.</li>
          <li>Requires the use of Tombstones when a DID is deactivated.</li>
          <li>Provides affordances for DID migration and archiving (for end-of-life
            and migration from non-cooperative server scenarios).</li>
          <li>Specifies optional but recommended Witness mechanism.</li>
          <li>Specifies optional but recommended Cache Control property.</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Target system
      </h2>
      <p>
        The target system of the <code>webhash</code> DID method is the host
        (or domain if the host is not specified) name when the domain specified
        by the DID is resolved through the Domain Name System (DNS).
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Method name
      </h2>
      <p>
        The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>webhash</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
        <code>did:webhash</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
        lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is specified
        below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Method-specific identifier
      </h2>
      <p>
        The method specific identifier is a fully qualified domain name that is
        secured by a TLS/SSL certificate with an optional path to the DID
        document. The formal rules describing valid domain name syntax are
        described in [[RFC1035]], [[RFC1123]], and [[RFC2181]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The method specific identifier MUST match the common name used in the
        SSL/TLS certificate, and it MUST NOT include IP addresses. A port MAY be
        included and the colon MUST be percent-encoded to prevent a conflict
        with paths. Directories and subdirectories MAY optionally be included,
        delimited by colons rather than slashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, a hash value for the unsigned "payload" of the
        currently-valid DID document (i.e., the "backwards-compatible" one that
        is also a valid did:web document) MAY be appended (delimited by a
        colon), after the path if present, to any webhash method identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax of a <code>webhash</code> DID string, expressed as a pseudo
        regular expression, is:<br>
        <code>did:webhash:{valid domain}[:[^/:#?]+]*[:{hash of first DID document}]{0,1}</code>
      </p>

      <pre class="nohighlight">

      <h2>
        Key Material and Document Handling
      </h2>
      <p>
        Due to the way most web servers present content, it is likely that a
        particular `did:webhash` document will be served with a media type of
        `application/json`. If a document is retrieved and it is named
        `did.json`, it can be parsed as a JSON object; depending on the contents
        of the <code>proof</code> object(s) attached, it can be verified as a
        valid JSON-LD document (see section
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#consumption-0">6.3.2</a> of the
        [[did-core]] specification.) and/or reconstructed to form a a valid JWS
        truple (see section
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#consumption-0">6.3.2</a> of
        the
        [[did-core]] specification) for verification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a DID URL is present within a `did:webhash` document, it MUST
        be an absolute URL *without* the hash-segment appended.
      <p class="note">
        This includes URLs inside of embedded key material and other metadata, and
        prevents key confusion attacks.

        <p>
          There is intentionally no HTTP API specified for the did:webhash

        <p>
          Creating a DID is done by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            applying at a domain name registrar for use of a domain name and
          </li>
          <li>
            storing the location of a hosting service, the IP address at a DNS
            lookup service
          </li>
          <li>
            creating the payload DID document (without <code>proof</code>
            object) that will be hashed and then signed with all the relevant
            keys referenced at absolute DID URLs <strong>without</strong> a hash
            segment appended.
          </li>
          <li>
            signing the unproofed DID document with a approprate keypair from
            the DID document and appending one or more <code>proof</code>
            objects to the DID document containing and describing said signature
            (See the section "Signing DID Documents" for default method and
            alternatives).
          </li>
          <li>
            hashing the proofed DID document to generate the "hash segment"
            needed for both publishing and securely using the DID. (See the
            section "Generating entropic identifiers for DID documents" for more
            default method and alternatives).
          </li>
          <li>
            publishing the proofed DID Document as the file
            <code>did.json</code> at the domain (qualified or unqualifed) that
            the did identifier (without hash segment) translates to when
            <code>:</code>s are replaced with <code>/</code>s, <strong>as well
            as</strong> the domain (qualified or unqualified) that the did
            identifier (with hash segment) translates to when <code>:</code>s
            are replaced with <code>/</code>s.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For example, for the domain name `w3c-ccg.github.io`, the `did.json`
          will be available under the following URL:
        </p>

        <div class="issue" data-number="2"></div>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating the DID">

          </pre>

        <p>
          If an optional path is specified rather than a bare domain, the
          <code>did.json</code> will be available under the specified path:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"

        <p>
          If an optional port is specified on the domain, the port colon
          splitting the host and the port MUST be percent encoded to prevent
          collision with the colons used as separators between domain,
          optional path, and entoropic identifier.

        <p>
          The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document from

        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Replace ":" with "/" in the method specific identifier to obtain the

          </li>
          <li>
            If the domain contains a port, percent-decode the colon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate an HTTPS URL to the expected location of the DID document

          <li>
            Perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL using an agent
            that can successfully negotiate a secure HTTPS connection, which
            enforces the security requirements as described in <a

          When generating a new DID document, the value of root DID document
          property <code>prev</code> should be set to the current DID
          <strong>with</strong> the version-specific hash segment appended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once updated, the new DID document must be published. The
          <code>did.json</code> corresponding to the identifier
          <strong>without</strong> a hash segment appended must be replaced with
          a new (and newly-proofed) DID document. This new DID document MUST
          also be published at the path corresponding to the identifier

          Generating entropic identifiers for DID documents
        </h3>
        <p>
          As the name webhash would imply, each DID document published to the
          web is intended to be addressable stably and archivally by an entropic
          identifier, such as one produced by a deterministic and standard hash
          function. This allows a "microledger" style history of each DID, since
          each DID document after the first contains a back-link to the previous
          one in the form of a <code>prev</code> property, the value of which is
          includes the hash of the previous unproofed DID document. It also
          enables multiple witnessing structures to "mirror" or sync witnessed
          DID documents across architectures, and even for DID histories to span
          multiple domains (although these cannot be considered verified without
          some form of additional input from a witness of some kind).
        </p>
        <p>
          To generate a deterministic hash, canonicalize an unproofed DID
          document according to <a
          href=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785>RFC 8785</a>, for which
          standard tooling is readily available at time of press. The hash
          function and expression used is a <code>SHA256</code>
          ASCII-encoded as a 32 characters in the <code>base58btc</code>
          alphabet. This is commonly referred to as a <a
          href=https://github.com/multiformats/cid#cidv0>"CIDv0"</a> in
          IPFS-based systems for content-addressed key/value storage, and common
          IPFS tooling can be used to generate such hashes from canonicalized
          JSON objects regardless of an implementation's choice of storage or
          witnessing mechanisms.

          Historical Query and Walking Backlinks
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dynamic web services or complex redirecting policies MAY be
          implemented to allow consumers to query by resolution metadata via
          query parameters like <code>?versionId=</code> or
          <code>?versionTime=</code> (see section

          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-document-metadata">7.1.3</a>
          of the [[did-core]] specification), but this is not required for
          conformance. Publishing according to this specification allows
          witnesses and consumers alike to reconstruct the entire history of a
          given did by recursing through the <code>prev</code> property of each
          resolved and verified DID document starting at the presently-valid one

          DNS Considerations
        </h3>
        <h4>
          DNS Security Considerations
        </h4>
        <p>
          DNS presents many of the attack vectors that enable active security
          and privacy attacks on the did:webhash method and it's important that
          implementors address these concerns via proper configuration of DNS.
          For example, without proper security of the DNS resolution via <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">DNS over HTTPS</a> it's
          possible for active attackers to intercept the result of the DNS
          resolution via a Man in the Middle attack which would point at a
          malicious server with the incorrect DID Document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, implementors should be aware of issues presented by a
          Spoofed DNS records where the record returned by a malicious DNS
          Server is inauthentic and allows the record to be pointed at a
          malicious server which contains a different DID Document. To prevent
          this type of issue, usage of DNSSEC which is
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC4033</a>,
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034">RFC4034</a>, and
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035">RFC4035</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>
          DNS Privacy Considerations
        </h4>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of the did:webhash method relying upon a DNS in order to
          resolve the web server, all resolutions of a did:webhash identifier have
          the potential to be tracked by a DNS provider. Additionally, due to
          the DID Document being stored on a web server, each time the DID
          Document resource is retrieved, the web server has the ability to
          track the resolution of the DID Document. To mitigate the issue of the
          relying party being tracked when resolving the DID Document the
          relying party should look to either use a trusted universal resolver
          service to gain herd privacy, utilize a VPN service or perform a
          resolution over the TOR network. Another emerging solution that will
          be useful to address this is <a

        </p>

        <p>
          It is additionally recommended to adhere to the latest recommendations
          from OWASP's Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet [[OWASP-TRANSPORT]]
          for hardening TLS configurations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consult <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-5/final">

          a specific key is authorized for use or in which the keys for a given
          system or application may remain in effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          TLS configuration MUST use at least SHA256, and SHOULD use SHA384,
          POLY1305, or stronger, depending on the needs of your
          operating environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Delete action MAY be performed by domain name registrars or DNS lookup
          services.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of this writing, TLS 1.2 or higher SHOULD be configured to use
          only strong ciphers suites and to use sufficiently large key sizes.
          As recommendations may be volatile these days, only the very latest
          recommendations should be used. However, as a rule of thumb,
          the following set of suites is a reasonable starting point:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            ECDHE with one of the strong curves {X25519, brainpoolP384r1, NIST
            P-384, brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} shall be used as key exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            AESGCM or ChaCha20 with 256 bit large keys shall be used for bulk
            encryption
          </li>
          <li>
            ECDSA with one of the strong curves {brainpoolP384r1, NIST P-384,
            brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} or RSA (at least 3072) shall be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) shall be used
            as Mac.
          </li>

        <h3>
          Optional Path Considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          When optional paths to DID documents are used to resolve documents
          rather than bare domains, verification with signed data proves that
          the entity in control of the file indicated in the path has the
          private keys. It does not prove that the domain operator has the
          private keys.
        </p>

        <p>
          This example:
        </p>

        <pre class="nohighlight">
did:webhash:example.com:u:bob
          </pre>
        <p>
          resolves to the DID document at:
        </p>
        <pre class="nohighlight">
https://example.com/u/bob/did.json
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this scenario, it is probable that example.com has given user Bob
          control over the DID in question, and proofs of control refer to Bob
          rather than all of example.com.
